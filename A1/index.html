    <h1>The Lyrics</h1>
    <h2 class="Title">"Someday"</h2><h4 class="Title"><i>Mariah Carey</i></h4>
      <p class="lyrics">You were so blind to let me go<br>
        You had it all but did not know<br>
        No one you'll find will ever be<br>
        Closer to all your dreams than me<br>
        Believing the grass would be greener<br>
        You told yourself "I just don't need her now"<br>
        But I know you'll soon discover<br>
        You're never satisfied with any other</p>
     <p class="lyrics">Someday, oh someday<br>
        The one you gave away<br>
        Will be the only one you're wishing for<br>
        Someday, hey hey<br>
        Boy you're gonna pay,<br> 
        'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score</p>
     <p class="lyrics">You'll change your mind and call my name<br>
        Soon as you find they're all the same<br>
        And when you find yourself alone<br>
        Don't come back crying<br>
        You should have known<br>
        Believe me I'm not pretending<br>
        It's not hard to predict<br>
        This ending now<br>
        'Cause I know you'll soon discover<br>
        You're needing me in spite of all the others</p>
     <p class="lyrics">Someday, oh someday<br>
        The one you gave away<br>
        Will be the only one you're wishing for<br>
        Someday, hey hey<br>
        Boy you're gonna pay,<br>
        'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score</p> 
     <p class="lyrics">Maybe now you just can't conceive<br>
        That there will ever come a time when you're cold and lonely<br>
        Baby, how could you ever believe<br>
        That another could replace me, the one and only<br>
        But when your down in your time of need<br>
        And you're thinking that you might be coming back to own me<br>
        Just think again 'cause<br>
        I won't need your love anymore!</p>
      <p class="lyrics">Someday, oh someday<br>
          The one you gave away<br>
          Will be the only one you're wishing for<br>
          Someday, hey hey<br>
          Boy you're gonna pay,<br>
          'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score</p>
